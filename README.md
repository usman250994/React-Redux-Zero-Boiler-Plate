This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Code Splitting

We have used the methodology; Separation of concerns, 
where every screen has its own personal actions, and state and
all is imported in main store for initial state 
and same goes for controller

only screen will have initial states and actions
components will descend with them..  (dumb Components)

also there is a separte style file for every screen and components (both)
this way every component and screen will be independant

using ES6 has helped alot in summing up the project
